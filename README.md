### Steps on how to create GitHub pages:
    1. Go to GitHub, Settings > Danger Zone, then set repository visibility to public.

    2. Then go to Settings > Pages, under Branch, set repository to 'main'.

    3. Make sure your html file is named 'index.html'. To see your page: go to Settings > Pages, open the link shown.

    ### Congratulations! You can now see your page, hosted by GitHub.


### Key takeaways from this exercise?
    - Envision and try to finalize what is needed in your design before making. Less stress and problems later!
    
    - Start with a template, then customize it to your liking. Makes it easier. (I used a barebones template from my project back then for this exercise)

    - I need to learn other faster ways of making webpages. This took too long... 

    - Git is your friend :3
